  <p class="projectDescription">
    In this project, I built a simple Mock-Trading Website, where you can buy
    and sell cryptocurrencies.<br />
    The frontend of this website is built with Angular, and the
    Angular-Material-UI library. The login process and the underlying database
    was created with Google-Firebase.
    <br />
    <br />
    The goal of the project is to finally settle the debate that you would have
    definitely gained money if you just had bought some Bitcoins, two weeks
    ago.<br /><br />
    The data used in this project is fetched from the
    <a href="https://nomics.com/">Nomics API</a> where the values get updated
    every 10 seconds.
