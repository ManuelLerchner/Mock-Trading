    <h1>About this project:</h1>

    <p class="projectDescription">
      In this project, I built a simple Mock-Trading Website, where you can buy
      and sell cryptocurrencies.<br />
      The frontend of this website is built with Angular, and the
      Angular-Material-UI library. The login process and the underlying database
      was created with Google-Firebase.
      <br />
      <br />
      The goal of the project is to finally settle the debate that you would
      have definitely gained money if you just had bought some Bitcoins, two
      weeks ago.<br /><br />
      The data used in this project is fetched from the
      <a href="https://nomics.com/">Nomics API</a> where the values get updated
      every 10 seconds.
